# ODIN benchmark

ODIN benchmark for data extraction solutions for structured data. The benchmark is designed to evaluate the backend of these solutions (especially the acquisition phase) by simulating the ingestion, storage and retrieval of streams of RDF data. To this end, ODIN emulates loads faced by triple store during the insertion of triples by an extraction solution for enterprise data (e.g., industry sensors) based on models derived from real data. The key performance indicators during the evaluation are completeness and efficiency.
